<p id="about">
The purpose of this website is to facilitate the sharing of information which is achieved through providing a platform for users to come and anonymously share various types of files.<br> Through clicking on the upload tab, in the top of the page, the user will be directed to a form where they can then choose to upload multiple files. We encourage users to upload any content they feel may be useful for other users, however it is not a requirement to view content that has already been uploaded.<br>Clicking the View tab will take the user to a table of user submitted content. The content can be viewed by clicking the link in the column, File Name, and deleted by clicking the Delete link.<br>To search through the uploaded content for a specific file, or files uploaded by a specific user, users only need to click on the search tab.
